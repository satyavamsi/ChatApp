## Overview

This project was built using React.js as frontend with firebase as backend.

The design is inspired from Slack.

All the communication happens real-time, thanks to firebase.

Any user can create channels and post comments.

## Planned Updates

I am planning to link channels to specific users so that they can invite users to the channels they created and so on.
